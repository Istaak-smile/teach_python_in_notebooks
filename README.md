# Introduction to Python Programming

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter/IPython Notebooks introducing programming concepts in Python. The notebooks are intended to guide students in learning the basic functionality of programming Python, and some of the most frequently used modules. 

## Running Notebooks ##

To run a notebook open a _Terminal_, and type the following command:

    jupyter notebook

The notebook will launch in a browser from the present working directory.

## Programming Environment

These notebooks are written in **Python 3**. 

If the default Python on your system is Python 3, if you are running Python 2, you might want to consider adding Python 3 to your system. 

N.B. if you are not sure which version of Python you are running then open a  _Terminal_, and type the following command:

    python -V

In this regards, you may find useful to take a look at the *Programming Environment* [notebook]() where you 
could find links and details on how to set up your environment depending on your platform.

### Requirements

* Python 3.x (2.x would work as well)
* IPython 4.x (with **notebook support**) or Jupyter: 
    * `pip install ipython[notebook]` (OR)
    * `pip install jupyter`

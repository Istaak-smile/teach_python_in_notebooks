# Introduction to Python Programming#

This repository contains a curated collection of Jupyter/IPython Notebooks of 
introductory materials about programming in Python.

Edited from: [Valerio Maggio](https://github.com/leriomaggio/python-in-a-notebook)

## Goals ##

Notebooks are intended to guide students in learning the basic functionality of programming Python using Jupyter Notebooks. 

The main goals of this project are to :
- Introduce students to the basics of Python programming;
- Introduce best practice as early as possible, while remaining accessible to students with no background in programming at all;
- Provide teachers an easy-to-use material about programming in Python to be used in their lectures

## Running Notebooks ##

To run a notebooks open a _Terminal_, and type the following command:

    jupyter notebook

The notebook will launch from the present working directory in a browser.

## Programming Environment

These notebooks are written in **Python 3**. 

If the default Python on your system is Python 3, then you will have a simpler time contributing to the project. 
If you only have Python 2, you might want to consider adding Python 3 to your system. 

In this regards, you may find useful to take a look at the *Programming Environment* [notebook]() where you 
could find links and details on how to set up your environment depending on your platform.

N.B. if you are not sure which version of Python you are running then open a  _Terminal_, and type the following command:

    python -V

### Requirements ###

* Python 3.x (2.x would work as well)
* IPython 4.x (with **notebook support**) or Jupyter: 
    * `pip install ipython[notebook]` (OR)
    * `pip install jupyter`

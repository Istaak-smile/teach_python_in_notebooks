# Introduction to Python Programming
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter/IPython Notebooks introducing programming concepts in Python. The notebooks are intended to guide students in learning the basic functionality of programming Python, and some of the most frequently used modules. 

## Getting started
### 1. Install Python
If you have not yet installed Python the [**Anaconda**](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) distribution by [**Continuum Analytics**](http://www.continuum.io/) is highly recommended. Anaconda is a completely free enterprise-ready Python distribution for large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing. Anaconda includes an easy-to-use installer for almost every platform, drastically reducing the burden of setting up the environment. In addition it comes packaged with the most useful Python libraries.

### 2. Run Jupyter Notebook
To run a notebook open a _Terminal_, in the directory of this course, and type the following command:

    jupyter notebook

The notebook will launch in a browser from the present working directory.

### 3. Start learning
Begin working your way through the numbered courses in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x (2.x would work as well)
* IPython 4.x (with **notebook support**) or Jupyter: 
    * `pip install ipython[notebook]` (OR)
    * `pip install jupyter`

N.B. these coursenotebooks are written in **Python 3**, if you are running Python 2, you might want to consider adding Python 3 to your system. If you are not sure which version of Python you are running then open a  _Terminal_, and type the following command:

    python -V
